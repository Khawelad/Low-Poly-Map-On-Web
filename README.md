This project is a low-poly map generator implemented using Poisson disc sampling, Delaunay triangulation, and noise mapping techniques. It takes a set of randomly generated points and applies Delaunay triangulation to connect them, forming triangles. A noise map is then applied to add depth and variation to the map. The average height of each triangle's vertices is calculated, and based on this value, a color is assigned to the triangle. The end result is a visually appealing low-poly map with a unique color scheme based on elevation.
